==================
Colour Basic Rules
==================

***Players:*** 2 +

***Game Length:*** 20 - 60 Minutes 

Basic Premise: 
===============

Colour is based around the most common building blocks of any card game.
In effect they are playing the meta itself, each game is a mini-meta.
You spend each turn building your foundation and attempting to tear down
your opponents. There are elements that users might find familiar with
games like Puzzle Quest, this is especially in regards to the Role
cards.

Key: 
=====

Each of the five colors represents a basic aspect of the game:

*Red = How much damage is dealt*

*Green = How many resources are generated*

*White = How much damage is prevented*

*Blue = how many cards are drawn*

*Black = How many cards you can keep in your hand*

Victory Conditions: 
====================

Reduce your opponent to 0 resources.

Setup: 
=======

The Players choose a Role card to represent them. They then construct a
30 card deck with no more than 2 of any one card that hopefully plays to
the strength and/or shores up weaknesses found on their chosen Role
card. Players Must have a reliable way of keeping track of each color
pool (usually five 20 sided dice, one of each color). 

- 1 Role card

- 30 Card deck

- 5 Twenty sided dice (d20)

Start of Game:  
================

Each player shuffles their 30 card deck and offers the opponent the
opportunity to cut the deck. Each Player then rolls dice, the player
with the highest total plays first.  The players then simultaneously
reveal their role cards and set their color pools to the totals
designated on the role cards. The player who won the roll now starts
their turn.

In Depth:
=========

Resource Step:
--------------

At the start of a Players turn they choose one of their five color pools
and increase it by 1.

Draw Step:
----------

The active player draws cards equal to their Blue color pool.

Play Step:
----------

The active player may choose to activate an ability on their Role card;
paying any associated costs and then resolving the effects. The player
may then play cards with color slots equal to or less than in total to
their Green color pool. Set the played cards face up in front of you. 

Resolution Step:
----------------

Tally the color totals of each card played by the active player this
turn. The active player then adds the current total of their Red color
pool towards one of these totals (even if the current total is 0).
Subtract the defending players White color pool total from a single
resolving color pool. Devide each pool in half round down. The defending
player reduces each of their color pools by this number. Finally the
active player increases their color pools based on the total of the
played cards.

Discard Step:
-------------

The active player discards cards until they have cards in hand equal to
their Black color pool total. The next player now begins their turn.
