Weston East
===========

Is a play on words. Last name Weston, I live on the east coast. "Head west on east" sounds like something some one would say when giving very clear directions. I went with it.

What We Do
==========

I have spent over a decade trying to launch a title, First it was a video game, hats off to all the opengl programmers out there. Then a pen and paper rpg. Now a card game.

I realized while making the card game, I was designing a framework first, the game was to follow. I took a liking to this, so I decided to make it a thing. I try to design gaming frameworks that can be used to simulate a multitude of games. Think if it as a D20 system . . . . but for board / card games.

Reaching Me
===========

I have a day job. By email works best.
